# Link Manager Technical Specification

## Overview

Link Manager is a client-side web application designed to help users organize bookmarks and links in a hierarchical structure. The application provides an intuitive user interface with drag-and-drop capabilities, favorites, and quick access to recently used groups.

## Architecture

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Storage**: Browser's localStorage API
- **Dependencies**:
  - Font Awesome 5.15.4 (for icons)
  - No server-side components required

### Data Model

#### Groups Structure

```javascript
{
  id: "1234567890", // Timestamp used as unique identifier
  name: "Group Name",
  links: [], // Array of link objects
  subgroups: [] // Array of child group objects
}
```

#### Link Structure

```javascript
{
  id: "1234567890", // Timestamp used as unique identifier
  title: "Link Title",
  url: "https://example.com"
}
```

#### User Preferences

```javascript
// Favorite groups
favoriteGroups = ["groupId1", "groupId2", ...]; // Array of group IDs

// Recent groups
recentGroups = ["groupId1", "groupId2", ...]; // Array of group IDs in order of recency
```

### Storage Schema

- `linkGroups`: JSON-stringified array of group objects

   - DOM manipulation is minimized

2. **Memory Management**
   - Event listeners are properly managed
   - No memory leaks from circular references

3. **Storage Limitations**
   - localStorage is limited to ~5MB per domain
   - Large numbers of links might approach this limit

## Browser Compatibility

The application is compatible with:
- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 60+
- Safari 12+
- Edge 80+

Required browser features:
- localStorage API
- ES6+ JavaScript
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Drag and Drop API

## Future Enhancement Possibilities

1. **Search Functionality**
   - Global search across all groups and links
   - Real-time filtering as user types

2. **Import/Export**
   - Export data as JSON for backup
   - Import from JSON, HTML bookmarks, or other formats

3. **Advanced Link Features**
   - Tags/categories for links
   - Notes or descriptions
   - Last visited tracking

4. **Visual Customization**

## Technical Limitations

1. **Storage Constraints**
   - localStorage is limited by browser (typically ~5MB)
   - No built-in data compression

2. **Single Device Usage**
   - No native synchronization between devices
   - Data lives only in the browser where it was created

3. **No Offline Access to Linked Content**
   - Links require internet connection to be useful
   - No content caching or archiving

4. **Security Considerations**
   - Data is stored unencrypted in localStorage
   - Accessible to any JavaScript running on the same domain
