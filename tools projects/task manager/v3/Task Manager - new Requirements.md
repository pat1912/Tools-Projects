request 3: the manage categories window is using the browser window. i want you will design one that looks nice like all other window you design. look for all other windows like this on all software and change them to your design nice looking and easy to use.
request 4: i tested one of the importants logics that this app do and it moving automaticly the task from :"Deferred Tasks" to "Active Tasks" when the defer date arrived. for example : if i defer task for tomorrow so in the next day start from 12:00 PM the task need to be on the "Active Tasks" grid. i tested it and its not working. you need to think about cases when the app runing and 12:00 PM arrived and also when the app is close and it will be runing the day after or few days after so the task need to be in "Active Tasks".

Request 1: Multiple Category Selection in Filters
I'll modify the category filter to allow selecting multiple categories simultaneously instead of just one.
Request 2: Redesign Note Window to Match Reddit Style
I'll redesign the notes modal to match the Reddit design from your screenshots, including both the English and Hebrew layouts with proper RTL support.
Request 3: Redesign Category Management Window
I'll create a consistent, nicely designed modal for category management that matches the styling of the other windows in the application.
Request 4: Fix Task Deferral Logic
I'll fix the deferral logic to correctly move tasks from "Deferred Tasks" to "Active Tasks" when the defer date arrives, handling both cases:

When the app is running and the defer time (12:00 PM) arrives
When the app is closed and reopened after the defer date has passed


# Task Manager Enhancement Requests

## 1. Multi-Category Filter
Enhance the category filter functionality to allow selecting multiple categories simultaneously, rather than just one at a time. This will enable users to view tasks belonging to different categories at once, providing more flexible filtering options.

## 2. Reddit-Style Notes Interface
Redesign the notes window to match Reddit's modern comment interface. This redesign should follow the examples provided in both English and Hebrew screenshots, ensuring proper RTL support and maintaining the same visual style and functionality as seen on Reddit.

## 3. Modernized Edit Windows
Update all basic edit windows and prompts throughout the application (like the simple "Edit category name" dialog shown in Image 1) to match the cleaner, more modern style of the main Edit Task window (shown in Image 2). This ensures visual consistency across all dialogs with the same rounded corners, clean layout, and styled buttons, creating a more professional and cohesive user interface.

## 4. Fix Deferred Tasks Logic
Correct the task deferral mechanism to ensure tasks automatically move from "Deferred Tasks" to "Active Tasks" at the appropriate time. Specifically:
- When the defer date arrives and it's 0:00 PM, tasks should automatically become active
- When the app is reopened after the defer date has passed, any deferred tasks that should be active are correctly displayed in the Active Tasks list

These enhancements aim to improve the user experience, visual consistency, and core functionality of the Task Manager application.
