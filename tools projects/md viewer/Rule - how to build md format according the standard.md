# Guidelines for Creating Standard Markdown (.md) Files

These guidelines help ensure your `.md` files are correctly interpreted by most Markdown parsers and viewers, avoiding common pitfalls like unintended code blocks.

## 1. Paragraphs

*   Separate paragraphs with at least one **blank line**.
*   Do not indent regular paragraphs.

```markdown
This is the first paragraph.

This is the second paragraph. It starts on a new line after a blank line.
