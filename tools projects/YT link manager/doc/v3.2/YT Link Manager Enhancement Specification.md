# YT Link Manager Enhancement Specification

This document outlines future enhancements for the YT Link Manager application, focusing on browser extension integration.

## Browser Extension Integration

### Overview
A companion browser extension would enhance the YT Link Manager by enabling deeper integration with YouTube and providing more convenient ways to save videos.

### Technical Specification

#### Extension Architecture
- **Components**:
  - Background script (service worker)
  - Content script for YouTube pages
  - Popup interface for quick actions
  - Options page for configuration
- **Permissions Required**:
  - `tabs`: To access current tab information
  - `storage`: To store settings
  - `activeTab`: To access the current page
  - Host permissions for youtube.com

#### Integration Methods
1. **Direct API Communication**
   - Extension communicates with web app via a defined API interface
   - Options:
     - **LocalStorage**: Extension writes directly to the same localStorage used by the web app
     - **Custom Events**: Extension dispatches events that web app listens for
     - **Background Synchronization**: Extension stores pending additions that sync when web app opens

2. **Context Menu Integration**
   - Adds "Add to YT Link Manager" to browser's right-click menu
   - Available on YouTube video pages and links
   - Configuration to control when it appears:
     - On all pages
     - Only on YouTube
     - Only on links that point to YouTube

3. **YouTube Page Integration**
   - Injects a custom button under YouTube videos
   - Appears next to native YouTube buttons (like, share, etc.)
   - One-click saving to the collection
   - Optional feedback when a video is already in collection

#### Extension Features
- **One-Click Saving**:
  - Add current YouTube video with a single click
  - Badge or indication when current video is already saved
  - Option to add with note in a popup

- **Batch Operations**:
  - Save all videos from a playlist
  - Select multiple videos from search results
  - Import from YouTube bookmarks or liked videos

- **Notifications**:
  - Success/error feedback when adding videos
  - Counter showing total videos in collection
  - Optional notifications for new uploads from saved channels

- **Search & Navigation**:
  - Search your saved videos directly from extension
  - Jump to the web app with deep links to specific videos
  - Category/tag management (future enhancement)

#### User Flow Examples
1. **Basic Addition Flow**:
   - User watches a YouTube video they want to save
   - Clicks the extension icon or injected button
   - Video is instantly added to collection with success feedback
   - Optional popup appears for adding a note

2. **Context Menu Flow**:
   - User finds a YouTube link on any webpage
   - Right-clicks the link and selects "Add to YT Link Manager"
   - Extension extracts the video ID and metadata
   - Video is added to collection with notification

3. **Bulk Addition Flow**:
   - User opens a YouTube playlist
   - Clicks extension icon and selects "Add all videos"
   - Extension processes each video sequentially 
   - Shows progress and completion summary

#### Technical Challenges
- **Cross-Origin Restrictions**:
  - Browser security prevents direct communication between extension and web app across domains
  - Solution: Use shared storage (localStorage) or message passing protocols

- **Authentication & Security**:
  - Ensuring only the legitimate extension can add to the user's collection
  - Optional: Add basic authentication between extension and web app

- **Versioning & Compatibility**:
  - Maintaining compatibility between extension and web app versions
  - Graceful degradation when features don't align

#### Implementation Steps
1. **Initial Development**:
   - Create basic extension with icon and popup
   - Implement core functionality to save current video
   - Test communication with web app

2. **YouTube Integration**:

   - Add listeners for YouTube page events
   - Implement visual feedback on YouTube pages

3. **Advanced Features**:

   - Implement batch operations
   - Create options page for customization

4. **Distribution**:
   - Package extension for Chrome Web Store
   - Create Firefox add-on version
   - Implement auto-update mechanism

#### Benefits of Browser Extension
